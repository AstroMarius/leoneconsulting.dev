    {
      "question": "What is NOT included in an MVP Sprint?",
      "answer": "Not full production-ready development. MVP is functional but may lack: advanced auth, edge cases, polished UI/UX, complete test coverage, enterprise scalability. It's designed to validate, not replace full-scale development."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I extend the MVP after the sprint?",
      "answer": "Yes. Codebase is clean and structured specifically to be extended. You can do it internally or we can continue with additional sprints."
    },
    {
      "question": "How 'working' is the prototype?",
      "answer": "100% functional for core features defined in scope. Not a clickable mockup: it's a deployed app you can use, test with real users and integrate with external services."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I change scope during the sprint?",
      "answer": "Yes, within reasonable limits. We work iteratively: if a feature becomes less priority after first test, we can change it. But significant scope creep extends timeline."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I own the code?",
      "answer": "Yes, 100%. Complete ownership of repo, code, deploy. After handover, you're the owner."
