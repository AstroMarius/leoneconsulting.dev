  "problem": {
    "description": "A growing e-commerce had data scattered across Shopify, Google Analytics, Facebook Ads, and a custom CRM. Reports were manual and took days. Cross-platform analysis or calculating complex metrics like LTV was impossible.",
    "painPoints": [
      "Data in 4 different systems, no unified view",
      "Weekly reports required manual CSV exports and Excel merging",
      "Impossible to calculate LTV, CAC or other strategic metrics",
      "Marketing decisions based on partial or outdated data"
    ]
  },
  
  "constraints": {
    "timeline": "6 weeks",
    "budget": "Medium budget, focus on quick ROI",
    "technical": [
      "API rate limits of third-party platforms",
      "Incomplete historical data (some months missing)",
      "Limited internal technical team (1 junior developer)"
    ]
  },
  
  "solution": {
    "architecture": "Cloud-native data pipeline: Fivetran for ingestion from Shopify/GA/FB Ads → BigQuery as data warehouse → dbt for transformations → Metabase for visualization. Airflow for orchestration and scheduling.",
    "keyDecisions": [
      "Fivetran for ingestion (no-code, reliable) instead of custom scrapers",
      "BigQuery for storage (pay-per-query, scalable, zero maintenance)",
      "dbt for data modeling (SQL, version control, testable)",
      "Metabase for BI (self-service, doesn't require dedicated data analyst)"
    ],
    "approach": "Incremental implementation: week 1-2 = infrastructure setup + first source (Shopify), week 3-4 = add GA and FB Ads + first metrics, week 5-6 = complex dbt models (LTV, cohorts) + team training."
