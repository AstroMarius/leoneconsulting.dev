  "problem": {
    "description": "The company managed operational KPIs through Excel files shared via email, with data manually extracted from 3 different systems. The process required 2 days/week and data was often outdated or inconsistent.",
    "painPoints": [
      "Manual reports required 2 days of work per week",
      "Outdated data by distribution time (48h delay)",
      "Transcription errors and corrupted Excel formulas"

  "constraints": {
    "timeline": "4 weeks",
    "budget": "Limited budget for SME",
    "technical": [
      "Integration with legacy ERP without documented APIs",
      "On-premise server with network limitations",

      "Sensitive business data, no public cloud"

  "solution": {
    "architecture": "Self-hosted dashboard with daily ETL from 3 data sources. Python for ingestion, PostgreSQL for storage, Metabase for visualization. Deployed on client's on-premise VM.",
    "keyDecisions": [
      "Metabase instead of custom solutions to reduce maintenance",
      "Nightly scheduled ETL to minimize impact on production systems",
      "CSV export from legacy ERP instead of screen scraping (more stable)",
      "PostgreSQL on Docker to simplify backups and migrations"
    ],
    "approach": "Iterative: first ETL for most critical data source, then progressive addition of others. Dashboard co-designed with stakeholders through weekly reviews."
