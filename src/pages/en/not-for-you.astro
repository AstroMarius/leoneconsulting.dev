            </h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              I don't do branding, graphic design, marketing, social media management, SEO copywriting, 
              or complex infrastructure project management. I'm a <strong>technical specialist</strong>, 
              not an agency.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm">
              <strong>Alternative:</strong> Look for a full-service digital agency or in-house multidisciplinary team.
            </p>

              ❌ If Budget Is Your Main Criterion
            </h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              If you're looking for "the lowest price," I'm not competitive. My rates reflect 
              4+ years of experience, code quality, and measurable results. If your only KPI is 
              "how much does it cost?", there are cheaper (and often riskier) options.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm">
              <strong>Alternative:</strong> Junior freelancers, offshore teams, or platforms like Upwork/Fiverr.

              ❌ If You Need 24/7 Ongoing Support
            </h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              I work on <strong>defined projects with clear start and end</strong>, not on continuous retainers 
              or on-call support. If you need someone "always available" for small changes or 
              daily troubleshooting, that's not my model.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm">
              <strong>Alternative:</strong> In-house developer, agency with retainer contract, 
              or managed service provider.
            </p>

              ❌ If "You Don't Know What You Want Yet"
            </h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              I work well when there's a <strong>clear problem to solve</strong>, even if the solution 
              isn't defined. But if you have no idea what you want to achieve, what resources you have, or 
              "just want to explore," it's probably too early to start.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm">
              <strong>Alternative:</strong> Start with an audit or discovery call to define objectives. 
              If even after a 30-minute call no clear problem emerges, wait until you have more clarity.
            </p>

              ❌ If You Want to "Delegate Everything and Disappear"
            </h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              My projects require <strong>active collaboration</strong>: access to systems/data, 
              feedback on prototypes, validation of priorities. I'm not a black box producing code in isolation. 
              If you expect to brief me once and then check back in 3 months, it won't work.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm">
              <strong>Alternative:</strong> Agencies with dedicated project managers or offshore dev shops 
              that work more autonomously.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- 6. Zero Tolerance for Iteration -->
          <div class="border-l-4 border-red-500 pl-6 py-4">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">
              ❌ If You Expect "Perfect on First Try"
            </h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              Technical projects involve iteration. Requirements evolve, assumptions get validated, 
              edge cases emerge. If you expect pixel-perfect, bug-free, fully-featured V1 on first deployment 
              with zero changes, that's unrealistic and we'll both be frustrated.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm">
              <strong>My approach:</strong> Ship fast, gather feedback, iterate. MVP → V2 → V3, not waterfall.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- 7. Technology Dictators -->

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">
              ❌ If You've Already Decided on Tech Stack (For Wrong Reasons)
            </h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              If you insist on "must be built in [obscure framework X] because my nephew uses it," 
              that's a red flag. I recommend tech based on <strong>problem fit, scalability, maintainability</strong>, 
              not trends or personal preferences. If you're inflexible on tech for non-technical reasons, we'll clash.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm">
              <strong>Exception:</strong> If you already have a tech stack for valid reasons (existing team, infrastructure), 
              that's fine—I'll work within those constraints.
            </p>

          <!-- 8. Expecting Mind Reading -->
          <div class="border-l-4 border-red-500 pl-6 py-4">
            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">
              ❌ If You Expect Me to "Just Know" What You Want
            </h2>
            <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
              I ask questions. Lots of them. Ambiguity kills projects. If you answer questions with 
              "you're the expert, you figure it out" or get annoyed by clarification requests, 
              we'll waste time on rework. I need your domain knowledge; you need my technical knowledge.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-600 text-sm">
              <strong>My approach:</strong> Collaborative discovery. I won't move forward on assumptions—I validate first.
